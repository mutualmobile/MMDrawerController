##[0.4.0](https://github.com/mutualmobile/MMDrawerController/issues?milestone=8&page=1&state=closed) (Monday, August 19, 2013)
###New
* **State Restoration Support** - `MMDrawerController` now supports state restoration, and will save the state of the open side as well. Consult the [documentation](https://github.com/mutualmobile/MMDrawerController#state-restoration) for more information. ([#69](https://github.com/mutualmobile/MMDrawerController/pull/69)). (Kevin Harwood, djibouti33)
* **Better Subclass Support** - `MMDrawerController` now contains an additional Subclass header file, to allow subclasses to access protected methods of the framework. Please consult the [documentation](https://github.com/mutualmobile/MMDrawerController#subclassing) for additional details on how to properly subclass `MMDrawerController`. ([#37](https://github.com/mutualmobile/MMDrawerController/pull/37)). (Lars Anderson)

* **Improved parent drawer controller detection** - `mm_drawerController` will now walk up the entire view controller stack looking for the parent, making it easier to access the drawer controller from any child view controller in the hierarchy.

([#25](https://github.com/mutualmobile/MMDrawerController/pull/25)). (Kevin Harwood)
